# Quantium Retail Data Analysis
This repository contains R scripts and data visualizations created during my Data Analytics Internship at Quantium. Over the course of this project, I analyzed over 200,000 transaction records to derive insights into consumer purchasing behaviors and evaluated performance across more than 270 retail stores.

### Consumer Behavior Analysis
- Analyzed transaction data to identify purchasing patterns of different customer segments.
- Tools used: R, dplyr, ggplot2.

### Trial Store Analysis
- Conducted AB testing on store layouts to evaluate the impact on sales performance.
- Developed an algorithm for matching trial stores with control stores based on sales and customer count.

### Sales Trend Visualization
- Created over 30 R-based data visualizations to present sales trends and trial outcomes.
