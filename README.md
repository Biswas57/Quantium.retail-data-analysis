# Quantium Retail Data Analysis
This repository contains R scripts and data visualizations created during my Data Analytics Program at Quantium. Over the course of this project, I analyzed over 200,000 transaction records to derive insights into consumer purchasing behaviors and evaluated performance across more than 270 retail stores.
### Overall
- Analysed 200,000+ transaction records using R to identify consumer purchasing behavior and evaluated data from over 270
stores.
- Employed statistical methods like linear regression analysis to gain understanding about the between between different
variables and sales and propose performance strategies.
- Conducted 5 comprehensive store analyses and 30+ R-based data visualisations on sales trends for specific retail stores,
specifically on customer behaviour, trial store testing and controlled sales performances, directly contributing to key strategy
recommendations.

### Consumer Behavior Analysis
- Analyzed transaction data to identify purchasing patterns of different customer segments.

### Trial Store Analysis
- Conducted AB testing on store layouts to evaluate the impact on sales performance.
- Developed an algorithm for matching trial stores with control stores based on sales and customer count.

### Sales Trend Visualization
- Created over 30 R-based data visualizations to present sales trends and trial outcomes.
